# Zomato Restaurant Intelligence Dashboard

A Power BI learning project that transforms raw Zomato restaurant data into actionable insights for restaurant performance, cuisine trends, and geography-based patterns.

---

## Project Goal
To convert semi-structured Zomato restaurant data into structured business intelligence that supports:
- Analysis of restaurant ratings and trends
- Exploration of cuisine popularity
- Geographic segmentation of restaurant listings
- Insights into service attributes (delivery, booking)

This project emphasizes analytical approach, modeling decisions, and interactive reporting.

## Dataset Overview
- Raw restaurant data sourced from Zomato
- Includes attributes such as:
  - Restaurant Name
  - Cuisines
  - Aggregate Ratings
  - Delivery and Booking options
  - Votes or Reviews

The dataset is used to derive business-relevant dimensions and measures for reporting.

## Analytical Approach
- Cleaned and shaped raw data using Power Query
- Built a **star schema** with a central fact table and dimension tables for key attributes
- Created metrics for rating distribution, cuisine popularity, and regional segmentation
- Designed interactive filters and slicers for dynamic exploration

---

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Power BI data modeling (star schema)
- Data transformation and normalization
- DAX for metrics such as:
  - Rating distributions
  - Trend aggregates
  - Segment comparisons
- Interactive report design using slicers and visuals

---

## Outcome
The dashboard enables structured analysis of:
- Overall restaurant performance
- Cuisine-level patterns and preferences
- Rating trends across geographies
- Service and customer experience signals

---

## Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query
- DAX

## Note:
This project was created as a **learning and portfolio piece** to demonstrate core Power BI competencies and analytical reasoning and is not an enterprise level project.
